Linear Regression:
----------------------
line equation - > y = m * x + c

m(slope) -> ∑(x - (mean of x)(y - (mean of y))/∑(x -
(mean of x))^2.

c(intercept) -> mean_y - (m *mean_x)

ypredicted -> m * x + c

r^2 -> ∑(ypredicted - mean of y )^2/ ∑(y
- mean of y)^2


steps for applying machine learning algorithm

- Data Preparation

- Machine Learning Model Intialization

- Fitting data to model

- Predicting output for test data

- Model Evaluation
	- r^2 score(if it is >=0.5 model is working fine otherwise need to train the model
	with more data)
